						This table block has a custom class of "amount"
						added to the cost column. I'm not sure how we
						want to handle this, but I have some ideas.
						Maybe we give the users an option to make the
						table a cost table. If so, then the amount class
						is added to the last td in each row inside
						tbody. Or it could be added to any td that has
						the class of "amount", which could be another
						setting. Or we disregard this entirely and make
						all tables look the same. Who knows!

							I have added another table here for testing.
							Normal table blocks will only have one
							table, as well as one content above the
							table (containing a title and description)
							and one content below (containing the
							button).

							I would like people to have the option to
							span the th across all columns. So however
							many columns are created needs to become
							colspan="Number" in the th.
